            <h2>Description</h2>
            
            <p> 
            Today activity trackers such as the Apple Watch or Fitbit motivates people to live a healthy lifestyle while being aware 
            of the activity you completed during the day. 
            In a similar way, iCarbon will be used to motivate people to live a more sustainable life by making small changes in 
            their everyday life. By keeping track of, for example, what you eat, or the amount of time you spend in a car, the app 
            will evaluate your day and challenge you to reduce your carbon footprint over time. 

            The iCarbon app can also connect to your home devices which in turn also can track temperatures, electricity used in your 
            home - the more devices that are connected the more accurate your carbon footprint will be and the more the app will be able 
            to motivate lifestyle changes. 
            </p>
            
            <h2> How iCarbon Works</h2>
            
            <p>
            The main part of the app will consist of meters showing you how much electricity you used, how much time in a day 
            you spent in transport, and what food you have been eating. Just as the Apple activity allows you to set 
            calorie/move/standing goals for a day, this app will set electricity, transport and food goals for you. If you are 
            close to going beyond these goals, you will be alerted with a warning. <br> <br>

            Similarly, to the Apple Activity apps, there will also be challenges which the user of the app will be prompted to solve. 
            If a challenge is overcome, you will be awarded with badges and stickers for your messaging app. As you download the app,
            it will come with original challenges - "Bike to school/work ten times", "Don't buy meat for a week" etc. - which will 
            advance in "difficulty" after having been completed. For example, if you get the badge for bicycling to work ten times 
            you will get a bronze badge and a new, more difficult challenge will automatically appear - "Bike to school/work fifteen
            times". <br> <br>

            There will also be randomized challenges popping up as notifications in the app which must be finished in a certain number 
            of hours. For example: "Buy coffee using a reusable cup".
